# Assignment 1 - Storage Manager 

The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple storage manager - a module that is capable of reading blocks from a file on disk into 
memory and writing blocks from memory to a file on disk. The storage manager deals with pages (blocks) of fixed size (PAGE_SIZE = 4096 bytes). 
In addition to reading and writing pages from a file, it provides methods for creating, opening, and closing files. 
The storage manager maintains several types of information for an open file: The number of total pages in the file, the current page position 
(for reading and writing), the file name, and a POSIX file descriptor or FILE pointer.

Following is the interface implemented:

### Page Related Methods

**- initStorageManager:**
This method is called to initialize the storage manager.

**- createPageFile:**
This method creates the given filename of default page size ( i.e. 4096 bytes) using function called fopen() and writes '\0' in it.

**- openPageFile:**
This method opens the recently created file and returns ```RC_FILE_NOT_FOUND``` if the file does not exist else returns ```RC_OK```.

**- closePageFile:**
This method closes the opened file. The parameter used is fhandle.

**- destroyPageFile:**
This method destroys the file using remove() also a check is applied if a file is tried to open after deletion, it gives appropriate error.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Read Related Methods

**- readBlock:**
This method reads the pageNum'th block from a file & stores its content in the memory pointed to by the memPage page handle. 
If the file has less than pageNum pages, the method return ```RC_READ_NON_EXISTING_PAGE```. lseek() is used to set the offset to the pointer. (PAGE_SIZE * pageNum)

**- getBlockPos:**
This method returns the current page position.

**- readFirstBlock:**
This method is used to read the first block. In lseek() the offset is set to 0 and whence parameter is set to ```SEEK_SET```.

**- readPreviousBlock:**
This method reads the previous page relative to the ```curPagePos``` of the file. In lseek() offset is set to ```PAGE_SIZE```.

**- readCurrentBlock:**
This method reads the current page relative to the ```curPagePos``` of the file. In lseek() offset is set to 0 and whence parameter is set to ```SEEK_CUR```.

**- readNextBlock:**
This method reads the next page relative to the curPagePos of the file. In lseek() offset is set to ```PAGE_SIZE```.

**- readLastBlock:**
This method is used to read the last block. In lseek() the offset is set to ```PAGE_SIZE``` and whence parameter is set to ```SEEK_END```.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Write Related Methods

**- writeBlock:**
This method writes a page to disk using the given position of ```pageNUM```. lseek() is used to set the offset to the pointer. (PAGE_SIZE * pageNum)

**- writeCurrentBlock:**
This method writes the current page to the disk. In lseek(), offset is set to 0 and whence is set to ```SEEK_CUR```.

**- appendEmptyBlock:**
This method increases the number of pages in the file by adding one page at the end of the file. The new last page is filled with '\0'. 
In lseek() offset is set to 0 and whence is set to ```SEEK_END```.

**- ensureCapacity:**
This method ensures that if the file has less than ```numberOfPages pages``` then increase the size to ```numberOfPages```.
